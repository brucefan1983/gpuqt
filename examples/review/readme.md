# Numerical examples in a review paper

* This directory contains examples presented in the review paper:

Zheyong Fan, Jose Hugo Garcia, Aron W. Cummings, Jose-Eduardo Barrios, 
Michel Panhans, Ari Harju, Frank Ortmann, and Stephan Roche, 
Linear Scaling Quantum Transport Methodologies, 
submitted to Reviews of Modern Physics, 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07387

* This is still in preprint form, so the figure labels might be changed later. Below are what we proposed for version 3.


| directory            | figure label in the review paper   |
|----------------------|---------------|
| square/ballistic         | 5 and 6 |
| square/diffusive         | 7  |
| square/weak-localization | 8 |
| square/strong-localization  | 9 |
| square/cubic         | 10 |
| graphene/wl-wal      | 11 |
| graphene/vacancy     | 13 |
